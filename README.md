# Pet-Controller
A backend application for controlling pets by storing and playing their owner's voice

As we know that pets are really attached to their owners even after they are not around this is the backend of the application built in NodeJs Express for user registration, pet registration, storing and retrieving audio using firebase and MongoDB for the basic commands to give instructions to the pet so that they do not get uncomfortable when their owner is not around.
